## Setup Instructions

**Prerequisites**

 - Node.js and npm installed.

 - MongoDB installed and running locally.

**Steps to Run the Project**

 1. Clone the repository:

    ```http
    https://github.com/parth-faldu/express.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd URL_Shortner  
    ```
3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install  
    ```
4. Set up the .env file:

    ```env
    PORT=3000  
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1/  
    MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME=urlShortener  
    ```
- Replace PORT with your desired server port.

 - Replace MONGODB_URI with your MongoDB connection string (e.g., if using a cloud database like MongoDB Atlas).

 - Replace MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME with your preferred database name.


**NOTE** :
 If you donâ€™t want to change database configurations, you can directly connect to your local MongoDB server.
